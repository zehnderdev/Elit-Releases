## Overview 
ELIT is a chaotic AI-powered party game where your words literally shape the world. As the prompter, you describe an object, an AI forges it into a 3D sculpture which you can paint. As a guesser, you fight, and outsmart others to uncover the hidden word. Across fast-paced rounds with power‑ups, combat, and a huge map, your creativity doesn’t just score points – it builds the entire playground you’re competing in.
