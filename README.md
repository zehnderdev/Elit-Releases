## About The Game
ELIT is a chaotic AI-powered party game where your words literally shape the world. As the prompter, you describe an object, an AI forges it into a 3D sculpture which you can paint. As a guesser, you fight, and outsmart others to uncover the hidden word. Across fast-paced rounds with power‑ups, combat, and a huge map, your creativity doesn’t just score points – it builds the entire playground you’re competing in.

## Gameplay

### Gamedesign
The game is built in [unity](https://unity.com), as a 3D round-based multiplayer concept.

The <b>core gameloop</b> resolves around:
1. Prompter-generated prompts around a given concept
2. AI-generated 3D objects
3. Deployment of 3D object inside package
4. Guesser guessing concept
5. Guesser and prompter receive points based on several factors
